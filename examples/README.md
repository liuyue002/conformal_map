Examples of outputs.

Observations and questions:

1, Look at 'z^{-1}.gif' and '(z-i)÷(z+i).gif', which are examples of Mobius maps. Observe how circles and lines are mapped to circles and lines.

2, Look at 'z^{-1}.gif', and observe that the image is flipped around near the pole at the origin. How does this relates to the Argument Principle?

3, Look at 'exp(z).gif'. Observe the periodic behavior with respect to the imaginary axis, and the two distinct behaviors as Real(z) approach ±∞.

4, Look at 'log(z).gif'. Can you guess where is the branch cut?
