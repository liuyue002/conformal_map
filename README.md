Demo for how the complex plane is transformed under various conformal maps.

The complex plane is periodically tiled with an image of St. Hugh's College, Oxford (taken by me in November 2020). The plane is then gradually transformed by a given complex map (infact by the inverse of the map, in a sense). This was originally made for the complex analysis course.
See the script in examples for how to run the code, as well as some questions for students.
